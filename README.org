* f90-namelist-mode

An extension to emacs f90-mode to handle Fortran namelists

* Installation

To install, put f90-namelist-mode.el somewhere in your emacs path, for example in =~/.emacs.d/f90-namelist-mode=, then put the following in your .emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/f90-namelist-mode/")
  (require 'f90-namelist-mode)
#+END_SRC

Fortran input files don't have a standard filename suffix, so you'll have to enable this mode manually with =M-x f90-namelist-mode=, or set a local variable. To do so, just put the following on the first line of your input file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ! -*- mode: f90-namelist -*-
#+END_SRC

or at the end of your file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ! Local Variables:
  ! mode: f90-namelist
  ! End:
#+END_SRC

* Planned features

1. Extend the comment regexp to include #
2. Define indentation rules for:
    - Comment only lines
    - Namelist start/end
    - Key-value line
3. Add functions to create/find the next/previous namelist/key/value and map them to appropriate keys.
4. Add function to align on regexp (and auto run it?)
