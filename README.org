* f90-namelist

An extension to emacs f90-mode to handle Fortran namelists

* Installation

Need to work out how to do this...


* Planned features

** TODO 1. Extend the comment regexp to include #
** TODO 2. Define indentation rules for:
 - Comment only lines
 - Namelist start/end
 - Key-value line
** TODO 3. Add functions to create/find the next/previous namelist/key/value and map them to appropriate keys.
** TODO 4. Add function to align on regexp (and auto run it?)
